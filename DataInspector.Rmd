To inspect data:

1.  Change the participant ID in the second line (keep quotation marks).
2.  Click the green triangle at the top right of the chunk to run it.

The output should be several plots, that you can switch between by clicking on tabs.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
source('R/inspecto.R')
# inspect('tora05f8a')
inspect('tor792279')
```
